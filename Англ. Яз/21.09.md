Радмила Игоревна



My name is Ilya and I am 17 years old. I enjoy writing software and studying. My favorite time of the year is winter. I enjoy skiing, snowboarding and ice fishing. I chose RTU MIREA because it offers a variety of student activities and provides a decent technological equipment for studying and conducting research. Also a lot of my friends and colleagues study or studied in MIREA. My father also studied on a similar program at university.


My family consists of me and two of my younger brothers. The youngest of them is Gleb, he is only 3 years old but he can speak Russian well for his age and he also studies a bit of English. My middle brother's name is Ivan. He is 10 years old and he loves camping. He has insane surviving skills and he is also a good fisherman.
